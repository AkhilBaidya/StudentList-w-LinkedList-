//C++ Programming: Student List Project
//by Akhil Baidya

//Date of Submission (mm/dd/yy): 10/16/23

/* Notes: In this program, the user will be able to edit a list of students.
The user can input the commands "ADD," "DELETE," "PRINT" and "QUIT." QUIT
exits the program.

   1. ADD registers a new student in the list. The user inputs the student's names,
   id, and gpa (the id and gpa must be inputted as numbers).

   2. DELETE removes a student from the student list. The user must input a student
   id to identify this student to be removed.

   3. PRINT displays all the students currently registered in the student list and their info.
