//C++ Programming: Linked List Project (an extension on the Student List Project)
//by Akhil Baidya

//Date of Submission: 01/03/24

/* Notes: In this program, the user will be able to edit a list of students.
The user can input the commands "ADD," "DELETE," "PRINT," "AVERAGE," and "QUIT."

   1. ADD registers a new student in the list. The user inputs the student's names,
   id, and gpa (the id and gpa must be inputted as numbers and the id should be non-negative).

   2. DELETE removes a student from the student list. The user must input a student
   id to identify this student to be removed.

   3. PRINT displays all the students currently registered in the student list and their info.

   4. AVERAGE calculates the average gpa of all the students registered in the student list

   5. QUIT deletes all of the students from the student list and exits the program

/*The AVERAGE() function recursively goes through each node in the linked list, counts the number of students and adds their gpa to a total, and carries over this count and total through each recursive step until reaching the final node.
